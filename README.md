# Free MIDI Chords

This is a collaborative project to create a collection of all chords
and useful chord progressions in all keys, as MIDI files, usable
with your favorite DAW.

This collection is FREE and you can contribute to it using the issue tracker above.
Please use the bug tracker if you find incorrect chords! 

All the files are licensed under the MIT license, and you can use in any project freely.

## Installation

Just download and unzip one of the [release file](/ldrolez/free-midi-chords/releases). 
Then drag and drop the MIDI files from your DAW to your tracks.
